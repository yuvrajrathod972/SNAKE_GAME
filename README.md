The Snake game project [Python]
– Designed and implemented the game mechanics, including the snake's movement, food generation, collision
detection, game over status and score tracking.
– Created graphical user interface (GUI) using Turtle library, including displaying the game screen, images,
and text.
– Implemented game logic and control flow using Python functions and loops

<h3 align="center">Snake game is a popular classic arcade game where the player controls a snake, which moves around a board eating food while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. In this project, we will build a version of the game using the Python programming language. The game can be created using the Turtle library, which provides a set of modules for building 2D games. We will start by importing the Turtle library and initializing the game window. We will also define the size of the window and the dimensions of the game board. Next, we will define the snake's initial position and size. The snake will be represented by a series of connected rectangles, which will grow in size as the snake eats food. We will also define the food's initial position and size, which will be randomly placed on the game board. The game loop will then begin, where the player can control the snake's movement using the arrow keys. The snake will move one square at a time, and if it collides with the wall or its own body, the game will end. If the snake eats the food, its size will increase, and the player will earn points. We will also implement a scoring system, which will keep track of the player's score as they eat more food. The game will end when the snake collides with the wall or its own body, and the player's score will be displayed on the screen. Finally, we will add some sound effects and music to make the game more enjoyable. Overall, the snake game project in Python will involve creating a game loop, defining the game board and the snake and food objects, implementing user controls, collision detection, and a scoring system.</h3>
